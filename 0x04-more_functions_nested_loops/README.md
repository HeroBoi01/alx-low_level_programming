0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
This project introduces nested loops and functions in C programming. It covers topics like using nested loops effectively, defining functions, function prototypes, and variable scope.

Learning Objectives

Define and use functions.
Differentiate between function declaration and definition.
Work with function prototypes.
Use -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89 flags for compilation.
Use header files with #include directive.
