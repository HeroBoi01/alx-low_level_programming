# C Preprocessor Project

This project demonstrates a script to run a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.

## Usage

1. Set the `CFILE` environment variable to the name of the C file you want to preprocess.
2. Run the script `0-preprocessor` to preprocess the specified C file.
3. The preprocessed output will be saved in the file `c` in the same directory.
