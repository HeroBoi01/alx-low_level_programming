# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

This project covers the concept of dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free` functions. It explores the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation and demonstrates how to use `malloc` to allocate memory on the heap and `free` to release the allocated memory.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- Use `malloc` and `free` to allocate and release memory dynamically
- Recognize when to use dynamic memory allocation
- Check for memory leaks using `valgrind`
